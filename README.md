# Problem Statement

## Challenge 1
### Better early childhood eduction, help college students to learn new skills or reskill people in the workforce.The possibilities are endless.

# Solution
## Abstract
### we are building an application targeting the students of classes 1-5.At early age children have curiosity to learn new things,wanted to know how things actually work or how they were evolved but they donot get the appropriate answers one reason being the busy schedule of their parents, or may be lack of proper knowledge.So we are providing solutions to their questions and giving shape to their curiosity.We will be providing them adaptive tasks according to their age groups and levels.For instance we will giving them riddles then the child will solve and identify the objects using the AR feature.
### Like, find an object with leaves and a brown trunk for a class 1 student.Then the answer to this is a tree.Then the student will scan and app analysis the result,after that we will be providing a complete information about the growth of the tree, species of the tree, how the fruits are growing on the tree.We will be providing this information throught Augmented Reality to make learning interesting. On the basis of their performance we will be generating progress report judging various cognitive skills. We will be analysing reactime time, perception, processing, listening and procedural thinking and will be providingthe personalized status growth report.The application will be generating the progress report which gives the parents an abstract view of theirchild's ability,interests and skills which help them to take better future decisions for them.
